        CBT is about how you think about yourself, the world and other people. How what you do affects your thoughts and
        feelings. Person Centred Counselling is an assessment of need that puts you at the centre of the process and is
        based on your views, choices and preferences. <br> <br>

        CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) CBT can help you to change how you think ("Cognitive") and what you do
        ("Behaviour") to make you think better and feel better. Instead of focussing on the causes of your distress or
        symptoms in the past, it looks for ways to improve your state of mind NOW. CBT has been found to be helpful in
        Anxiety, Depression, Panic, Agoraphobia, Social phobia, Bulimia, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD),
        post-traumatic stress disorder and Schizophrenia. CBT can help you to break vicious circle. CBT can help make

        <p class="text-muted pb-5 ps-5 mt-2">
          I will help you break each problem down into its separate parts and may ask you to keep a diary to identify
          your individual patterns of thoughts, emotions, bodily feelings and actions. <br> <br>
          Together we will look at your thoughts, feelings and behaviours to work out: <br> <br>
          - if they are unrealistic or unhelpful. - how they affect each other, and you.
        <ul class="text-muted ps-5">
          <li>I will then help you to work out how to change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours</li>
          <li>Home work will be recommended if you wish to practise changes in your everyday life.</li>
          <li>Depending on the situation, you might start to: <br>
            -Question a self-critical or upsetting thought and replace it with a positive (and more realistic) one that
            you have developed in CBT. <br>
            -Recognise that you are about to do something that will make you feel worse and, instead, do something more
            helpful.
            <br>
            -At each meeting you discuss how you've got on since the last session. <br>
            -I will help with suggestions if any of the tasks seem too hard or don't seem to be helping.
          </li>
          <li>I will not ask you to do things you don't want to do - you decide the pace of the treatment and what you
            will and won't try.</li>
        </ul>

       <p class="text-muted pb-5 ps-5 mt-3">
        The strength of CBT is that you can continue to practise and develop your skills even after the sessions have
        finished. This makes it less likely that your symptoms or problems will return. My main concern is with your
        wellbeing. I provide brief Intensive Counselling which will allow you to experience a quiet, personal reflection
        while facing issues deep within the heart. This atmosphere will enable you to understand who you are and how the
        events of your life have shaped your relationship with yourself, others and the world. The sessions are for
        those who are finding it difficult at work and at home in any area of life e.g. marriage, school, parenting,
        work, and relationship. All counselling is private and confidential for individuals or couples. I do not only
        identify your problems but will help you find solutions and create an atmosphere that will lead to change in the
        shortest amount of time. </p>

        You know yourself better, I do not profess to know you more than you know yourself. What I will do is to make every attempt to foster an environment in which you can encounter ‘yourself’ and become more intimate with your own thoughts, feelings and meanings. The idea behind this approach is that psychological disturbance occurs when your ‘self-concept’ begins to clash with immediate personal experience such as when the evidence of what you feel or do clashes with what you think you ‘ought’ to be feeling are doing. This sometimes happen when your positive view of yourself depends on the positive judgments of others. In other words, you feel worthy only when others are happy or satisfied with you. So as long as rely on a self-concept designed that meets the needs of others as opposed to yourself you will find that you are unhappy in many ways. This approach maintains that three core conditions provide a climate conducive to growth and therapeutic change. </p>

        <ul class="text-muted ps-5">
          <li>Unconditional positive regard</li>

          <li>Congruence</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-muted ps-5 mt-3">This means that your will be able to explore all thoughts and feelings, positive or negative, without danger of rejection or condemnation. You will have the freedom to explore and to express yourself in any way you wish without having to meet any particular ‘acceptable’ standards and I will be genuinely interested in what you have to say to become the person that you really are and not others want you to be! </p>

          Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT) draws on mindfulness and behaviour activations (BA) to encourage clients to increase the ability to engage in value-based, positive behaviours while experiencing difficult thoughts, emotions or sensations. According to ACT, psychological problems and distressed are caused by avoidance and an inability or difficulty in detaching from painful experiences. Fixating on these painful experiences which leads to a failure to take much needed action in suitable to your core values. </p>
